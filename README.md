# 🌐 Business Card - My First Real Web Project

A simple, interactive **developer business card** built with just **HTML5 and CSS3**.\
The card expands on hover; revealing my skills, and includes animated social icons. 
Although it's small, it taught me the fundamentals that everything else is built upon.

## 🛠️ What I've Built:

- A responsive, hover-expandable business card
- Clean layout structured with HTML5
- Custom styling using Pure CSS
- Social icons using SVGs
- Exposure to using Git & pushing changes to Github

This was the first time everything *clicked* for me. How HTML and CSS work together, how layouts are formed, and how to bring designs to life ✨.
